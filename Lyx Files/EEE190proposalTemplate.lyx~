Background of the Project
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section states the reasons why the project is being done.
 If the project is related to previous projects, a short history of what
 the previous projects accomplished shall be included.
 If the project is part of a larger work, a brief mention of the rest of
 the work shall be made.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Traffic congestion in the Philippines has always been a big problem.
 Back then, some highways and roads in Metro Manila with the exception of
 EDSA ave.
 has seen a small amount of congestion.
 Now it even reaches places outside the Metro and there are even cases of
 traffic in a large expressways.
 This is due to a large number of vehicle increase in the country.
 According to a statistical study, there already have been 29.4 million vehicles
 since 2013 [8].
 This is a huge number compared to other countries in Southeast Asia whose
 roads have the capacity to handle their total number of vehicles.
 Even schools or areas near them are not exempted from this problem.
 In the UP Diliman Area, some jeepneys have to drive along a section where
 there is a definite congestion of vehicles, which tends to make students
 late for their classes or appointments.
 This section is the CP Garcia.
 It also said that a lot of students would try to bring their own private
 vehicles instead of using public transportation accesible to them, but
 that leads to another problem of shortage in parking spaces in the campus.
 There are more than 3000 parking spaces lacking on all colleges 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "UndergraduateThesis"

\end_inset

.
 That signals the fact that traffic congestion is getting closer to communities
 with inadequate roads.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the following solution presented by an advocacy group in UP Diliman
 is to provide accessible bikes for the use of students.
 The group is named UP Bike Share.
 It tries to solve the problem of traffic congestion and the passenger congestio
n in jeepneys especially during the end of classes.
 Like other great ideas this one possesses its own problems, which are the
 loss of bikes.
 As of now bikes are of limited use due to this problem.
 It is because the campus is not practiced biking community.
 Some users do not have the knowledge to lock their bikes properly and that
 could lead to theft.
 Another reason is bikes are able to move in and out of the campus which
 is stricty prohibited, but Bike Share is unable to actually track if some
 bike are leaving the campus.
 Monitoring the bikes is clearly their main problem in terms of risk mitigation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A lot of tracking devices have been present and commercialy accesible like
 GPS.
 Bike Share tries not to use this device since they are power hungry despite
 of it being low cost.
 If GPS were used bikes need to have an immediate station for charging which
 are currently not found inside the campus.
 Instead they have decided to try implementing a wireless mesh network tracking
 system.
 WMN consists of sensor or nodes capable of being tracked in an area.
 It also has low power consumption and sensor are at a low cost.
 There are currently no bike tracking systems present in the country since
 this is one of its few bike sharing projects.
 Because of this, there is a definite demand for development of tracking
 systems not only to help Bike Share but also other projects that requires
 monitoring

Documentation Flow and Organization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before you end your introduction chapter, you should provide a brief description
 of the upcoming chapters.
 This gives the readers the idea on what to expect in your documentation.
 Show how each chapter relates to each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the following introduction the next chapters will try to focus on
 reviewing tracking algorithms and devices that can be implemented in a
 wireless mesh network tracking system, which is Chapter 2.
 Also we would discuss the problem statement and our objectives for this
 project on Chapter 3.

\begin_layout Standard
The following section will provide information about algorithms and devices
 regarding wireless mesh network tracking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Tracking Methods 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Numerous algorithms can be used for tracking in a wireless mesh network.
 All algorithms can be categorized into three general methods of tracking.
 These are proximity method, scene analysis method and triangulation method
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "1"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Proximity method uses sensor or nodes that would be able to identify a target
 near its vicinity or area 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "1"

\end_inset

.
 Sensors would look for signals sent by a target using transceivers or RFID
 tags.
 Usually a lot of nodes are positioned in different sections to cover the
 area of tracking.
 Proximity method is known for its robustness because of its ability handle
 some interference cause by the environment, and also because of its low
 cost setup.
 Despite of that, the method is only able to detect the vicinity of a target
 and not the exact location itself thus decreasing its accuracy.
 It is also not easy to arrange, since sensors should be positioned correctly
 or confusion regarding the location of a target can happen.
 It is usually used in small areas or indoor setups.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, scene analysis method studies the area of tracking to
 gather the signal strength of the target from a fixed sensor node with
 a given location.
 The signal strength would be tabulated along with its corresponding position
 to a database 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "1"

\end_inset

.
 After the analysis and installation, tracking would start and sensors would
 compare the acquired signal strength of the target to the ones stored inside
 the database.
 Even if there is a database, sensors would still need to estimate the location
 since not all signal strengths can be mapped to a particular position on
 the area.
 Scene analysis method usually provides an accurate position but at the
 expense of time of analysis.
 If there is a large area of tracking, especially in an outdoor environment,
 it would definitely take time to gather the signal strength at multiple
 positions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last method is triangulation, which needs at least three base stations
 with known coordinates.
 These base stations are essential in locating a target since the acquired
 signal strengths per base station would be used to calculate the distance
 between the station and the target.
 Using the stations as centers and the calculated distance to the target
 as radii for each circle, the three circles would intersect at a common
 point which would provide the location of the target.
 Sometimes the location is not accurate because of signal strength discrepancies
 so other methods were developed with triangulation as their basis.
 These are Coverage Area Based Algorithm and Ring Overlapping Localization
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "4794164"

\end_inset

.
 This method is ideal for outdoor tracking since base stations are capable
 of a large coverage area but targets require a high amount of energy for
 transmitting data.
 The transceivers of the target would likely need an immediate access to
 charging in this method.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Tracking Devices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are multiple devices applicable for tracking not only on wireless
 mesh networks but in general.
 Examples are transceivers, RFIDs, and GPS

\end_inset

.
 The latter two are usually the main device used for tracking and for personal
 use.
 Though they are accessible, GPS and RFID require stable power sources which
 would limit the productivity of the bikes.
 Some transceivers are also accessible with different prices and signal
 ranges.
 Some of these transceivers are RF100, MICAz motes, Radiometrix RPC418,
 and MIT's Cricket.
 The following were tested on an indoor environment because of its signal
 range limitation.
 There are other transceivers that are less documented but also suited for
 tracking in WMN.
 These are CC430F and CC1101, which are capable of reaching distance from
 500 meters to 2 kilometers.
 Other valuable specification can be seen in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Comparison-of-Multiple-Transceiver"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From comparison CC430F is probably the best choice for a transceiver to
 be used by the node, despite of it having a higher current consumption
 compared to the others.
 Its range is a big factor and also because it can be powered by two AA
 batteries.
 The range of possible frequency of operation for the CC430F is between
 300 MHz to 928 MHz 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "3"

\end_inset

.
 433 MHz would be the optimal frequency band since it is an unlicensed band
 and it is low enough such that its signal is able to pass through walls.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a device called Wizzimote which has an embedded CC430F transceiver
 with a MSP430 microcontroller it is shown in Figure 2.2.
 It also has an open source protocol stack called DASH7 capable of multihopping
 and collision avoidance properties.

As mentioned above DASH7 is an wireless technology that is an open source
 protocol stack used by Wizzimote.
 It is typically used for wireless sensor networks.
 Compared to other technologies like ZigBee, devices that use DASH7 has
 a wider range spanning up to 2 kilometers which is optimal for an outdoor
 project.
 It is also flexible in such a way that it can also propagate its signal
 for indoors, because DASH7 can penetrate thick walls easily unlike Wifi
 and Bluetooth

DASH7 technology is designed as a OSI 7 layer, and it is seen as an improvement
 for the ISO/IEC 18000-7 protocol.
 One of the main differences between the two technologies are their MAC
 transmission protocol.
 DASH7 uses Carrirer Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance while ISO/IEC
 18000-7 uses Slotted Aloha.
 The latter transmission is more prone to packet collision than the CSMA/CA
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "6831994"

\end_inset

.
 Collision of packets lead to delays in the network and for tracking system
 delays should be minimized as much as possible since target should be monitored
 carefully.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another difference between DASH7 and ISO/IEC 18000-7 is their utilization
 of channels.
 DASH7 can achieve a maximum of 8 channels while ISO/IEC 18000-7 has only
 one
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "6831994"

\end_inset

.
 With multiple channels, DASH7 would be able to lessen the collisions in
 a network.
 There are more difference between DASH7 and ISO/IEC 180000-7 shown on Table

Problem Statement and Objectives

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the previous chapter we have tackled the different algorithms that are
 being used to determine the location of a unit inside a wireless mesh network.
 In this chapter we would be dictating our problem statement and the our
 objectives of our project
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Problem Statement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently UP Bike Share intends to execute everything manually, i.e., rider
 registration, bike monitoring and quality control.
 In doing so they may not be able to check whether every rider is adhering
 to the rules that they have lain down, therefore there is no assurance
 that every bike is being used exclusively inside campus premises.
 There have been reports of bike sightings outside the vicinity of UP Diliman,
 e.g., Katipunan, Maginhawa, etc.
 They have also lost a few bikes since they have started, and this scenario
 can go on if no device is made to support their cause and strictly implement
 their rules.
 By creating a tech that could support their advocacy by tracking every
 bike in their arsenal, they would be able to track down the violators and
 give them a proper sanction, while ensuring that every bike and rider is
 kept safe and unharmed, leading towards a better biking community for UP
 Diliman.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Objectives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We intend to create an automated consolidating unit using a wireless mesh
 network that could monitor the whereabouts of the bike and the information
 of the rider that currently rented the bike.
 The bike share initiative intends to expand as the years progress, therefore
 that would mean more bikes, consequently more devices, since each bike
 would need its own tech, this is why the materials to be used to fabricate
 the device should be cheap.
 There is an initial plan that the tech could be powered by the pedaling
 motion of the biker, this can only be done if the device isn’t too power
 hungry.
 Riders wouldn’t like the idea of exerting too much effort in biking and
 keeping the device powered, that is why the device must need only a small
 amount of energy to power it.
 The device should have a way to monitor the whereabouts of the bikes accurately
 so that the location of each bike can be retrieved if or when needed.

\begin_layout Section
Inserting Chapters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the upper left dropdown menu of the LyX window, select 
\shape italic
Chapter
\shape default
.
 You can then type the chapter title that you want.
 Pressing Enter will revert the format to 
\shape italic
Standard
\shape default
, where the content can now be placed.
 Chapters are numbered and placed on the 
\shape italic
Table of Contents
\shape default
 automatically.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Inserting Sections
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the same dropdown menu where you insert a chapter, select 
\shape italic
Sections
\shape default
.
 The sections under the chapter are automatically numbered accordingly.
 These also appear in the generated 
\shape italic
Table of Contents
\shape default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Subsections
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can also add subsections and subsubsections.
 However, use them sparingly, especially the latter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Inserting Labels
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the chapter/section/image/table that you want to reference, click 
\series bold
Insert > Label
\series default
.
 You can use the default label that LyX generates for you.
 To 'call' it anywhere in your document, click the 
\series bold
Insert > Cross-reference
\series default
.
 This provides an efficient way of pointing out figure/table and chapter/section
 numbers, without the need to type out explicitly what the numbers are in
 the document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Inserting Floats
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figures and tables shall be included in the body of the documentation to
 illustrate or clarify the accompanying text.
 Thus, figures and tables must be referenced in the text in order for them
 to be meaningful.
 By convention, figure names should be placed below the image, while table
 names should be placed on top of the table.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, figures or tables should not appear in the document before they
 are mentioned in the text.
 By default, LyX does not follow this rule and places images or tables near,
 but not exactly after, the text referencing it.
 You can force the rule by right-clicking on the 
\shape italic
float:Figure
\shape default
 label in the LyX editor and going to 
\shape italic
Settings
\shape default
.
 In the window that appears, shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
